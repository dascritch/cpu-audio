<div class="cpu-audio-without-webcomponents too-old">
    <h2>Player didn't start (yet ?)</h2>
    <p>
    	Your browser is loading very slowly, or doesn't support WebComponent fairly enough.
        Following examples are <strong>not fully functionnal</strong>, as the interface is not shown and the browser display its native player. This is intentional.<br />
        Only the hash-links functions works.
