Planned evolutions
------------------

- [ ] Standards first

    - [X] [dotclear](https://github.com/dascritch/plugin-dotclear-cpu-audio)
    - [ ] wordpress
- [ ] `<video>` support
- [ ] `<track>` support for subtitles
	- [ ] better `srclang=""` support
- [ ] Sharing service companion
    - [ ] [Create a real playlist service](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/8)
    - [ ] [Supporting annotations Ã  la SoundCloud](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/10)
- [ ] [Prepare design and key bindings for RTL localizations](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/26)
- [ ] Propose a code snippet in `examples/` to do a `ticker` plane track mode
