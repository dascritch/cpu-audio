==========

Bugs
----

* A media error is not correctly triggered and unseen from its  `<cpu-audio>`. Chrome needs to be asked to go inside (click on the timeline), Firefox never gets it.
* To use correctly the webcomponents.js polyfill, as [it still lacks `<link rel="import">` support](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-components/), Firefox (Nightly, 63 as today) needs a CSP policy permitting `data:` scripts.
* Firefox versions 62 and below cannot start HTML Import version correctly even with the polyfill.
* Firefox versions 63 and upper seems to still have a focus trap into the WebComponent

Resolved standards issues
-------------------------

* [Middle click on canonical not working on Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1476302)
* [Key browsing focus is trapped inside the webcomponent on Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1476301)

Planned evolutions
------------------

- [X] report issues from `timecodehash` and `ondemiroir-audio-tag`
    - [X] link back from `timecodehash` and `ondemiroir-audio-tag`
