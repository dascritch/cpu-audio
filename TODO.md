Planned evolutions
------------------

- [ ] Standards first
    - [ ] use standard [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) in `hashOrder`, instead of the custom code. We need a strategy to get the anchor, seen as a key without value
- [ ] DOM manipulation events :
    - [ ] dynamic modification of `<head>`
    - [ ] dynamic modification of `document.location.href` (webapp)
- [ ] add-ons packages
    - [X] [dotclear](https://github.com/dascritch/plugin-dotclear-cpu-audio)
    - [ ] wordpress
- [ ] `<video>` support
- [ ] `<track>` support for subtitles
	- [ ] better `srclang=""` support
- [ ] Sharing service companion
    - [ ] [Create a real playlist service](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/8)
    - [ ] [Supporting annotations Ã  la SoundCloud](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/10)
- [ ] [Prepare design and key bindings for RTL localizations](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/26)
- [ ] Finish `ticker` plane track mode, or propose a code snippet in `examples/`
