Bugs
----

* A media error is not correctly triggered and unseen from its  `<cpu-audio>`. Chrome needs to be asked to go inside (click on the timeline), Firefox never gets it.
* Firefox versions 63 and upper seems to still have a focus trap into the WebComponent

Resolved standards issues
-------------------------

* [Middle click on canonical not working on Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1476302)
* [Key browsing focus is trapped inside the webcomponent on Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1476301)
