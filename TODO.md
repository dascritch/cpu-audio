Planned evolutions

    - [ ] wordpress
- [ ] `<video>` support
- [ ] `<track>` support for subtitles
	- [ ] better `srclang=""` support
- [ ] Sharing service companion

    - [ ] [Supporting annotations Ã  la SoundCloud](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/10)
- [ ] [Prepare design and key bindings for RTL localizations](https://github.com/dascritch/cpu-audio/issues/26)
- [ ] Propose a code snippet in `examples/` to do a `ticker` plane track mode
- [ ] Example add-on with FFT analyzer, like in [webcammictester](https://webcammictest.com/check-mic.html)
